commanders - have dead team mates instantly respawn

Commanders - gamble win/lose random amount of res up to 300

marine/alien ~ have random amount of res bounties places on said player that hook entitykilledfunction and reward attacker. If attacker res is full, give overloaded amount to team resources. If bounty commits suicide, then remove the bounty amount on that players personal resources. If that person does not have the bounty amount to remove, then ??? set to 0?
